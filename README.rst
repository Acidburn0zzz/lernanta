Batucada
========

Batucada is a ground up rewrite of drumbeat.org in `Django`_. 

.. _Django: http://www.djangoproject.com/

Installation
------------

To install Batucada, you must clone the repository: ::

   git clone git://github.com/paulosman/batucada.git

I recommend using ``virtualenvwrapper`` to manage your virtual environments. Follow the `installation instructions`_. Once installed, create your virtual environment for ``batucada`` and install the dependencies ::

   cd batucada
   mkvirtualenv batucada 
   pip install -r requirements.txt 

It is necessary to install the Python Image Libray: ::
	
   pip install pil
   [FIXME: Can this be done automatically in the previous step?]
   
You may need to create a settings_local.py file to override some of the default settings.
For example, you may need to `configure your email backend`_.
   
Finally, sync the database and start the development server. ::

   python manage.py syncdb --noinput 
   python manage.py runserver
