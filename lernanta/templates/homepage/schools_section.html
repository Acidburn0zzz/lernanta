                                    Universal access to and participation in research, education, and culture is made
                                    possible by openness, but not enough people know what it means or how to take
                                    advantage of it.
                                    We hear about Open Source Software, Open Educational Resources, and Open Access…
                                    But what are these movements, who are their communities, and how do they work?
                                    Most importantly—how can they help me?
