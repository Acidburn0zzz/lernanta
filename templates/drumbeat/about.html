  <em>Mozilla is all about shaping the future of the web for the 
  public good.</em> With Drumbeat, weâ€™re moving beyond Firefox to 
  build more things that make the web better, not just software. 
  We&apos;re doing that by reaching out to new kinds of people &ndash; 
  educators, filmmakers, journalists, scientists, artists &ndash; to 
  work together on open projects and design challenges that build a 
  better web and world. We did that with Firefox. Now we want to do 
  it on a broader scale, with new projects and people like you.

<h2>{{ _('How does Drumbeat make the world better?') }}</h2>
<p>
  Through open web tools and thinking. Applied to your personal passion or project. 
  Mozilla believes the internet is a shared public resource and force for good. If 
  we care about the web&apos;s future, we need a diverse range of people involved in 
  shaping the web in their world &apos; especially those trying to disrupt and innovate. 
  Drumbeat provides open web tools and thinking to help do this. And connects 
  innovators in areas like education, media and science with smart hackers and 
  technologists. The result? Drumbeat helps you build new projects the same way 
  Mozilla built Firefox &ndash; by working in the open, collaborating through open 
  web tools, and enabling participation from contributors around the world.
